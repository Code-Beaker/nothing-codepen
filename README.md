## Straight-to-the-point
Codepen URL: https://codepen.io/Tharun-raj/pen/XWymjwJ?editors=1100

## The boring thing
This **CodePen** pen is just as boring as it sounds. No purpose, nothing interesting. *Nothing* at all.

## Why?
You know. When you're *bored*, you get those random and exciting *ideas*. So this one is a *boring project*. I know people won't even open this Pen as they see the preview.

## How it started
You know that feeling when **CodePen** tells you to pay just to make your *garbage* Pen's visibility **Private**, don't you? I wanted to make this **Private**. But, I can't. **CodePen** won't let me do so. So It's public.

## Credits
All the credits are mine. I won't allow anyone to steal my **masterpiece**!
